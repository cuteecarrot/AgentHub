## Coding Standards

### Python

- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Add docstrings to functions/classes
- Keep functions focused and small

### Example

```python
def send_message(from_agent: str, to_agent: str, text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Send a message between agents.

    Args:
        from_agent: Sender agent ID
        to_agent: Receiver agent ID
        text: Message content

    Returns:
        True if message sent successfully
    """
    # Implementation...
```

### Shell Scripts

- Use `set -e` for error handling
- Quote variables: `"$VAR"`
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
